- 👋 Hi, I’m @5Owls
- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science and Machine learning(and building games as a hobby)
- 🌱 I’m currently a human learning machine learning on Udacity
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will expand my knowledge in the 
Data science and machine learning industry. But I would love to build my own game one day. 
So that will also be a wonderful thing to collaborate on.
